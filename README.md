I'm 17 years old and in the span of 2 years, I've been learning programming and gaining experience in frameworks such as Node.js, Alpine.js, Nunjucks and TailwindCSS. I've been creating static sites using Eleventy with Netlify, but later on migrated to Cloudflare.

Between 2022 and 2023, I started my Journey with learning HTML, CSS and Javascript and then focused on completing the IBM Full Stack Software Developer Professional Certificate. 

Then, at the beginning of 2024, I started gaining knowledge about how to use Hubspot CMS and HubL. 

I have completed the Hubspot CMS for Developers Certification and the Hubspot CMS for Developers II Certification. 

In June 2024, I've completed the Harvard CS50â€™s Introduction to Computer Science course.

I really love chess and puzzles, and in my extra time, I spend working on my chess ability and getting stronger.
